            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For where the ſtouteſt Champions are foyled and vanquiſhed, what hope is there to ſee the timerous and feareful victorers, if the wiſeſt haue bene put to ſilence if the Bookes of the learned Clearkes haue bene no more regarded, what comforte can the meaner forte haue? how may they thinke to ſpeede? or wherein ſhall they ſeeme to profite, when as their betters haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed ſo little? Who knoweth not howe greatlye in times paſt our aunceſtours reuerenced and honoured the learned, with what care and dilligence before the Arte of Printing was found out, they indeuoured to write out the Coppies of their writinges, what char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they beſtowed in penning their bookes, and what great ſommes of money they woulde gladlye departe withall, if they heard of any writer before vnknowne, reſpecting no charges, nor regarding any trauayle, ſo that they might obtain them, but nowe, who ſeeth not how all thinges are turned vpſide downe? and the Engliſh Prouerbes in all pointes verified: The nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt the Churche, the fartheſt from god: The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Clearkes, not the wiſeſt men: The greateſt brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the verieſt Cowardes: The lowdeſt ſounde, the emptieſt Veſſell: and breefelye to ſay the truth in one word, the greater knowledge, the leſſe following: eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man pretending himſelfe ſkilfull in his duetie, and yet ſcarſe one fulfilling the leaſt part therof in ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:7848:8"/>
that the Lacedemonian Ambaſſadours may now ſay vnto vs Engliſh men, as ſometime they did to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians, which is, that we know what is good, but yet we doe nothing leſſe, or as Hanniball that Noble Captaine gaue his Iudgement, as touching the Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Philoſopher which he had hearde: his words ſayeth he, are good, but yet I had rather haue him that can doe it in deede, then thoſe to ſitte and talke of that which ſhould be done.</p>
            <p>For as this our Authour whome we haue nowe in hande affirmeth, one deede profiteth more then a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande wordes, bee they neuer ſo ſweetelye ſpoken, the which Leſſon, I praye GOD it may bee both well remembered, as alſo better followed of all true Chriſtians, and eſpeciallye of vs, that as wee ſurpaſſe all other Nations, in the readineſſe and promptneſſe of Gods Booke, and haue nowe a long tyme both by hearing and Preaching, obtayned the veritie, ſo nowe to the confuſion of all our Aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wee woulde beginne to awake, and to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute, ſo framing our liues, through the aſſiſtaunce of Gods grace, that men ſeeing our good workes, may glorifie our Father which is in Heauen, and that oure loſte Bretheren, nowe ſtanding as it were agaſte, and amazed, with the lycenciouſneſſe of oure lyues, maye through our amendment bee broughte home againe, the wrath of God appeaſed, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey remaining in moſte happye and bleſſed eſtate, which otherwiſe is like through our naughtines and wickedneſſe to be whipped and ſcourged with manye Roddes: For as all men doe confeſſe, the Cleargie in former time to haue deſerued that ouerthrowe and
<pb facs="tcp:7848:8"/>
confuſion that happened vnto them, becauſe of their abhominable liues, and moſte deteſtable Idolatrie, in ſeducing and blinding of men with fancies and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. So ſurely if wee looke into our ſelues, wee ſhall finde that wee haue deſerued no leſſe, not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one path of iniquitye vntrodden, wherein they before had walked, nay rather adding more therevnto if poſſible it may be.</p>
            <p>But ſome man will ſay, what hath induced you to ſay or to thinke this of our Cleargy, ſeeing there is no ſuch vice in our Church. Ah my deare Bretheren, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not your ſelues, but rather calling to minde your owne frailtie, amende it, for it muſt needes bee true that all men ſay, and that which is ſo openly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to the whole world, to the greefe of all good men can not be hidden. But yet to let you to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why I haue inferred thus much as touching the licenciouſneſſe of this our time, becauſe I ſee it is the only thing whereof our Aduerſaries triumphe, yea it is their dayly aunſwere: I will know them to liue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before I beleeue them, and as their liues doe varry from that which they preach and teache to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo ſay they there is ſuch vncertaintie in their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſuch diſcord and variaunce among them, ſcarſe two remaining in one opinion, without any vnitye or concordaunce, that we know not whome to followe, and therefore vntill there be a better order taken, we aunſwere with Horace, <hi>Nullius addictus iurare in verba Magiſtri.</hi> Thus hath the Diuell firſt by ouerthrowing the fleſh and then ſecondarily ſowing of diuers opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in vnſetled heads, almoſt, nay I feare me altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confounded the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7848:9"/>But the Lord of his goodneſſe and mercy amend it and make vs ſo to ſhine in all godlineſſe and pureneſſe of life, that neither this old ſerpent, our deadlieſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie, neither any of his hyrelinges, maye haue any ſuch cauſe hereafter to brag or boſte of this their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo ioyfully looked for, but as I hope, neuer to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: And thus thinking both my labour, as alſo the trauaile of others nothing auaileable, to the amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the conuerſation of the outward man, excepte the inward man were firſt cured, and the abuſes of thoſe who hath the charge thereof ſharpely rebuked, I haue preſumed to vnburthen my conſcience, deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring firſt of all the perfect ground of chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to bee ſurelye layde at the verye bottome of euerye Chriſtian hart, with an vniforme conſent of the truth among all men, before I woulde ſeeme to inferre the morall inſtructions of anye Paynime, being nothing comparable to the former, neither any thing profitable except the other bee firſte rooted, (hoping alſo that the godlye and graue Fathers, and thoſe whoſe harts doe as it were blede with ſorrow to heare theſe my words will not ſeeme to take my ſayings as any thing preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall vnto them whoſe godly conuerſation though I lewdly would reproue, yet would the world teſtifie the contrary, who both ſeeth and commendes it and earneſtly alſo craueth their helping handes to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of the reſt) I will retourne to my ſelf again, who being as the Prouerbe is, the leaſt of the twelue, haue taken vpon me to offer vnto your ſightes and iudgementes theſe three Orations of that noble and famous Oratour Iſocrates, appertaining to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtructing and ordring of this our miſerable life.
<pb facs="tcp:7848:9"/>
The which though they be written by a man altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignoraunt of that true and onely God, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and maker of mankinde, yet doe they ſo neare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and accord with that Heauenly Doctrine of our cheefe maiſter and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, that I hope no man will thinke the time ill ſpent which he ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in the reading thereof, eſpecially thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bereft from the benefite thereof through their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce in the knowledge of the Greeke and Latine tongues, could not heretofore come to the perfite vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the ſame. And becauſe the Authour himſelfe, is in moſte places of theſe his preceptes bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer then either the matter would require or that the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of the meaner ſorte can ſo eaſilye gather the meaning thereof, I haue not ſpared for their furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to adiome vnto diuers places certaine reaſons and confirmations taken out of Ariſtotle &amp; Tully, as occaſion ſerued, comprobating and approuing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours intent. For according to the iudgement of Wolfius who learnedly hath tranſlated the ſame out of the Greeke into Latine: that which Ariſtottle and Tully haue written in large volumes the ſame doth Iſocrates comprehend in theſe his ſhort ſentences.</p>
            <p>Thou ſhalt alſo finde coted in the Margent, diuers worthy examples gathered out of ſundry writers, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the intent to reproue the careleſneſſe of this our time, in that being Chriſtians excuſing our ſelues by the frailtie of our weake natures, we willfully leaue thoſe things vndone, whiche the very Heathen and Painimes moſt perfitely fulfilled and obſerued. To vſe many words in deſcribing the determinated pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Authour in theſe his three Orations, were
<pb facs="tcp:7848:10"/>
but ſuperfluous labour, in that vnto the two latter there are prefixed two ſundry Prefaces, and as for the firſt to containe the whole breefelye in one worde, it comprehendeth the perfect direction of the life of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry priuate perſon, no leſſe delectable then profitable.</p>
            <p>And thus gentle Reader as one hauing detained thee ouer long from the reading of ſo learned a worke, as Iſocrates is, I am humbly to craue thee, for my bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incouragement in time to come, to yield vnto me in this my firſt enterpriſe, thy fauourable &amp; louing coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaunce, waying my ſlenderneſſe and imperfection with the readineſſe and promptneſſe of my good will, and ſo excuſing the one by the other to perſwade thy ſelfe that if ſkill with will were agreeable, thou ſhouldeſt eare long receiue a larger volume, yea, though Zoylus ſhoulde ſpitte his ſpitefull poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

The ſecond part is as touching the ſtate of a monarchie or gouernment of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnder one man alone, as is the rule and dignitie of an Emperour or king: herein confirming the right &amp; title which Nicocles had vnto the kingdome which he then poſſeſſed and enioyed.

When as Phocion was reproued becauſe he would not receiue the great treaſure that was ſent to him from Minillus, neither yet ſuffer his ſonne to receiue it, his aunſwere was that if his ſonne were of honeſt conuerſation, his patrimonye left vnto him would ſuffice him, but if he were a riotous and wanton liuer, neither that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, neither any other, would be ſufficient for him.

Carneades ſaying was, that Princes were neuer perfect in any thing but in riding, for ſaid he, it is the vſe of all men that haue to deale with them to flatter &amp; to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble with them but the horſe not caring whome he carieth be he King or Citizen, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons, throweth them of from his back, except they be ſkilfull in ordering &amp; riding of him. Antigonus the King of Macedon, being aſked why he ſo greatly eſteemed Zeno, becauſe ſaid he, I did neuer finde him to diſſemble with me in any thing when as one had ſayd vnto Theopompus, King of Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonia that the people of Lacedemonia ſhould be then moſt happye, when as their Princes had learned to rule well, thou ſaiſt truth ſaid the King, if the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple haue alſo learned in like ſort to obay.
